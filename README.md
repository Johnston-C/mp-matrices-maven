Overview:

This project contains an interface and class which creates an implementation of matrices. A matrix is a data structure with two 'length' fields, being 'width' and 'height'. Values can be stored and retrieved at indecies (x,y). Their type will be parametric.

The interface created is Matrix which has one parametric type T.

The class created is MatrixV0 which has one parametric type T.
